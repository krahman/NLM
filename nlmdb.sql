We aimed to test whether celecoxib has similar effects in a clinical setting. METHODS: In a randomised two-centre trial, we enrolled 274 patients who had angina pectoris or a positive stress test and who had native coronary artery lesions for which implantation of paclitaxel-eluting stents was feasible. All patients were given aspirin (100 mg daily) and clopidogrel (75 mg daily). 136 patients were randomly assigned to receive celecoxib (400 mg before the intervention, and 200 mg twice daily for 6 months after the procedure). The primary endpoint was late luminal loss on quantitative coronary angiography at 6 months after the intervention. Secondary endpoints were cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and revascularisation of the target lesion. Analysis was done on a modified intention-to-treat basis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00292721. FINDINGS: At 6 months, mean in-stent late luminal loss was lower in the celecoxib group (0.49 mm, SD 0.47) than in the control group (0.75 mm, 0.60) (absolute difference 0.26 mm; 95% CI 0.12-0.40). Frequency of secondary outcomes at 6 months was also lower in the celecoxib group, mainly because of a reduced need for revascularisation of the target lesion. INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that the adjunctive use of celecoxib for 6 months after stent implantation in patients with coronary artery disease is safe and can reduce the need for revascularisation of the target lesion.'),('1474-547X','Effect of remote ischaemic preconditioning on myocardial injury in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery: a randomised controlled trial.','Derek M','2007',8,'BACKGROUND: Whether remote ischaemic preconditioning, an intervention in which brief ischaemia of one tissue or organ protects remote organs from a sustained episode of ischaemia, is beneficial for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery is unknown. We did a single-blinded randomised controlled study to establish whether remote ischaemic preconditioning reduces myocardial injury in these patients. METHODS: 57 adult patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery were randomly assigned to either a remote ischaemic preconditioning group (n=27) or to a control group (n=30) after induction of anaesthesia. Remote ischaemic preconditioning consisted of three 5-min cycles of right upper limb ischaemia, induced by an automated cuff-inflator placed on the upper arm and inflated to 200 mm Hg, with an intervening 5 min of reperfusion during which the cuff was deflated. Serum troponin-T concentration was measured before surgery and at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after surgery. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00397163. FINDINGS: Remote ischaemic preconditioning significantly reduced overall serum troponin-T release at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after surgery. The total area under the curve was reduced by 43%, from 36.12 microg/L (SD 26.08) in the control group to 20.58 microg/L (9.58) in the remote ischaemic preconditioning group (mean difference 15.55 [SD 5.32]; 95% CI 4.88-26.21; p=0.005).

Adjuvantation is an important antigen-sparing strategy. We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant H5N1 split-virion vaccine formulated with a proprietary adjuvant system and investigated whether it can induce cross-reactive immunity. METHODS: Two doses of an inactivated split A/Vietnam/1194/2004 NIBRG-14 (recombinant H5N1 engineered by reverse genetics) vaccine were administered 21 days apart to eight groups of 50 volunteers aged 18-60 years. We studied four antigen doses (3.8 microg, 7.5 microg, 15 microg, and 30 microg haemagglutinin) given with or without adjuvant. Blood samples were collected to analyse humoral immune response. Adverse events were recorded up through study day 51. Safety analyses were of the whole vaccinated cohort and immunogenicity analyses per protocol. This trial is registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00309634. FINDINGS: All eight vaccine formulations had a good safety profile. No serious adverse events were reported. The adjuvanted vaccines induced more injection-site symptoms and general symptoms than did the non-adjuvanted vaccines, but most were mild to moderate in intensity and transient in nature. The adjuvanted formulations were significantly more immunogenic than the non-adjuvanted formulations at all antigen doses. At the lowest antigenic dose (3.8 microg), immune responses for the adjuvanted vaccine against the recombinant homologous vaccine strain (A/Vietnam/1194/2004 NIBRG-14, clade 1) met or exceeded all US Food and Drug Administration and European Union licensure criteria. Furthermore, 37 of 48 (77%) participants receiving 3.8 microg of the adjuvanted vaccine seroconverted for neutralising antibodies against a strain derived by reverse genetics from a drifted H5N1 isolate (A/Indonesia/5/2005, clade 2). INTERPRETATION: Adjuvantation conferred significant antigen sparing that could increase the production capacity of pandemic influenza vaccine. Moreover, the cross-clade neutralising antibody responses recorded imply that such a vaccine could be deployed for immunisation before a pandemic.'),('1474-547X','Sudden visual loss.','Victor','2007',10,'null'),('1474-547X','Essential hypertension.','Eberhard','2007',11,'Essential hypertension can be defined as a rise in blood pressure of unknown cause that increases risk for cerebral, cardiac, and renal events. In industrialised countries, the risk of becoming hypertensive (blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg) during a lifetime exceeds 90%. Essential hypertension usually clusters with other cardiovascular risk factors such as ageing, being overweight, insulin resistance, diabetes, and hyperlipidaemia. Subtle target-organ damage such as left-ventricular hypertrophy, microalbuminuria, and cognitive dysfunction takes place early in the course of hypertensive cardiovascular disease, although catastrophic events such as stroke, heart attack, renal failure, and dementia usually happen after long periods of uncontrolled hypertension only. All antihypertensive drugs lower blood pressure (by definition) and this decline is the best determinant of cardiovascular risk reduction. However, differences between drugs exist with respect to reduction of target-organ disease and prevention of major cardiovascular events. Most hypertensive patients need two or more drugs for blood-pressure control and concomitant statin treatment for risk factor reduction.

This Review aims to provide an overview on the modern management of atrial fibrillation, with particular emphasis on pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to assess the evidence for efficacy and safety of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine in vascular dementia. METHODS: PubMed, BIOSIS, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and Cochrane registries were searched for randomised, placebo-controlled trials on cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine in patients with vascular dementia. Trial methods, clinical characteristics, outcomes, and adverse events were extracted and checked. Meta-analytic methods using fixed-effects models were used to give summaries of each drug\'s effects. FINDINGS: Three donepezil, two galantamine, one rivastigmine, and two memantine trials, comprising 3093 patients on the study drugs and 2090 patients on placebo, met the selection criteria. Trials were of 6-month duration with similar vascular dementia criteria and outcome measures. Cognitive effects on the Alzheimer\'s Disease Assessment scale were significant for all drugs, ranging from a -1.10 point mean difference (95% CI -2.15 to -0.05) for rivastigmine to -2.17 for 10 mg daily donepezil (95% CI -2.98 to -1.35). Only 5 mg daily donepezil had an effect on the Clinicians\' Global Impression of Change scale (odds ratio 1.51 [95% CI 1.11-2.07]). No behavioural or functional benefits were observed, except for a -0.95 point difference (95% CI -1.74 to -0.16) with 10 mg daily donepezil on the Alzheimer\'s Disease Functional Assessment and Change Scale. Compared with placebo, more dropouts and adverse events (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and insomnia) occurred with the cholinesterase inhibitors, but not with memantine. INTERPRETATION: Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine produce small benefits in cognition of uncertain clinical significance in patients with mild to moderate vascular dementia. Data are insufficient to support widespread use of these drugs in vascular dementia. Individual patient analyses are needed to identify subgroups of patients with vascular dementia who might benefit.'),('1474-4422','Miglustat for treatment of Niemann-Pick C disease: a randomised controlled study.','James E','2007',16,'BACKGROUND: Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterised by an intracellular lipid-trafficking defect with secondary accumulation of glycosphingolipids. Miglustat, a small iminosugar, reversibly inhibits glucosylceramide synthase, which catalyses the first committed step of glycosphingolipid synthesis. Miglustat is able to cross the blood-brain barrier, and is thus a potential therapy for neurological diseases. We aimed to establish the effect of miglustat on several markers of NPC severity. METHODS: Patients aged 12 years or older who had NPC (n=29) were randomly assigned to receive either miglustat 200 mg three times a day (n=20) or standard care (n=9) for 12 months. 12 children younger than 12 years of age were included in an additional cohort; all received miglustat at a dose adjusted for body surface area. All participants were then treated with miglustat for an additional year in an extension study. The primary endpoint was horizontal saccadic eye movement (HSEM) velocity, based on its correlation with disease progression. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN26761144. FINDINGS: At 12 months, HSEM velocity had improved in patients treated with miglustat versus those receiving standard care; results were significant when patients taking benzodiazepines were excluded (p=0.028). Children showed an improvement in HSEM velocity of similar size at 12 months. Improvement in swallowing capacity, stable auditory acuity, and a slower deterioration in ambulatory index were also seen in treated patients older than 12 years. The safety and tolerability of miglustat 200 mg three times a day in study participants was consistent with previous trials in type I Gaucher disease, where half this dose was used. INTERPRETATION: Miglustat improves or stabilises several clinically relevant markers of NPC.

Neuromyelitis optica has a worldwide distribution, poor prognosis, and has long been thought of as a variant of multiple sclerosis; however, clinical, laboratory, immunological, and pathological characteristics that distinguish it from multiple sclerosis are now recognised. The presence of a highly specific serum autoantibody marker (NMO-IgG) further differentiates neuromyelitis optica from multiple sclerosis and has helped to define a neuromyelitis optica spectrum of disorders. NMO-IgG reacts with the water channel aquaporin 4. Data suggest that autoantibodies to aquaporin 4 derived from peripheral B cells cause the activation of complement, inflammatory demyelination, and necrosis that is seen in neuromyelitis optica. The knowledge gained from further assessment of the exact role of NMO-IgG in the pathogenesis of neuromyelitis optica will provide a foundation for rational therapeutic trials for this rapidly disabling disease.'),('1474-4422','Comparison of endovascular and surgical treatments for intracranial aneurysms: an evidence-based review.','Giuseppe','2007',30,'Intracranial aneurysms can be treated with endovascular or surgical techniques. We provide an objective comparison of these treatments, using data from single-centre studies, multicentre studies with and without independent outcome ascertainment, and randomised clinical trials. We compared the outcomes of patients who were candidates for endovascular treatment, surgical treatment, or both. In patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms, rates of aneurysm obliteration were higher, and need for second treatment was lower, after surgery than after endovascular treatment. However, in observational studies and randomised trials, outcome at discharge, at 2-6 months, and at 1 year, and later survival, were all better after endovascular treatment than after surgery. The results suggest that the higher rates of incomplete obliteration and retreatment after endovascular treatment do not affect patients\' clinical outcome. In observational studies of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms, discharge outcomes were better and hospital costs were lower after endovascular treatment than after surgery. These patients showed no difference between the two treatments in 1-year outcomes and later rebleeding, although few data were available for this comparison.'),('1474-4422','Fibrotic heart-valve reactions to dopamine-agonist treatment in Parkinson\'s disease.','Werner','2007',31,'BACKGROUND: Retroperitoneal and pleuropulmonary fibrosis are well known but rare complications of the treatment of Parkinson\'s disease with ergolinic dopamine agonists; however, until now, these complications have not substantially affected the routine clinical use of these drugs. The occurrence of restrictive valvular heart disease during treatment with pergolide and cabergoline caused concern about the safety of dopamine agonists in Parkinson\'s disease. Specifically, there is uncertainty whether fibrotic cardiac valvulopathy is due to exposure to these two ergolinic dopamine agonists or whether the abnormality is reversible. Changes in the heart valves can incur additional disability and worsen the clinical disorders of Parkinson\'s disease. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: Population studies of patients with Parkinson\'s disease compared with non-parkinsonian controls have reported that pergolide and cabergoline have a similar risk of inducing fibrotic changes in cardiac valve leaflets. The fibrotic changes cause thickening, retraction, and stiffening of valves, which result in incomplete leaflet coaptation and clinically significant regurgitation, and have necessitated surgical valve replacement in some patients. Pergolide and cabergoline have high affinity for the 5-HT(2B) serotonin receptors, which are expressed in heart valves and might mediate mitogenesis and, in turn, the proliferation of fibroblasts. When analysed together, current population studies of similar designs and doses report 102 patients on cabergoline, 245 patients on pergolide, 181 patients on non-ergot agonists (pramipexole and ropinirole), and 177 non-parkinsonian controls. The frequency of moderate-to-severe regurgitation in at least one heart valve was higher in patients receiving cabergoline or pergolide than in patients taking non-ergot agonists or controls, and the incidence of new-onset valvulopathy was high in patients taking the ergot-derived drugs. WHERE NEXT?: Because of the routine prescription of pergolide and cabergoline, the switching of patients to different treatment regimens might be difficult. Moreover, whether the fibrotic changes are reversible is unknown. Finally, these adverse events do not occur in all patients, and no susceptibility factors are known. Prospective studies will assess the full effect of these abnormalities and help establish whether and when mitral valve tenting area abnormalities become clinically relevant during chronic treatment. The exact pathway leading to valvulopathy is unknown, although agonism of 5-HT(2B) receptors in the heart is implicated as a mediator in the process. Other ergolinic dopamine agonists, such as lisuride, and non-ergot dopamine agonists are devoid of 5-HT(2B) agonistic activity; therefore, their use might not induce fibrotic changes in heart valves. However, further prospective studies are needed. Such studies should also clarify the clinical relevance of mild-to-moderate echocardiographic changes and their natural history. Because of the clinical consequences of the adverse reactions, we suggest that affinity for 5-HT(2B) receptors is routinely tested in future drugs, in the laboratory or in animals, before they are given to patients.'),('1474-4422','Homocysteine-lowering therapy: a role in stroke prevention?','J David','2007',32,'On the basis of the results of several recent clinical trials, many researchers have concluded that vitamin therapy designed to lower total homocysteine concentrations is not effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. However, whereas almost all myocardial infarctions are due to plaque rupture, stroke has many more pathophysiological mechanisms, and thrombosis-which is increased by raised total homocysteine concentrations-has an important role in many of these processes. Thus, stroke and myocardial infarction could respond differently to vitamin therapy. A detailed assessment of the results of the recent HOPE-2 trial and a reanalysis of the VISP trial restricted to patients capable of responding to vitamin therapy suggest that higher doses of vitamin B12 and perhaps new approaches to lowering total homocysteine besides routine vitamin therapy with folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 could reduce the risk of stroke.

The MC results show that, for a 27-Gy prescription to the 95% isodose line, Eclipse overestimates the volume of the rectum receiving more than 26 Gy (96%) by 2 approximately 10 cc and the volume of the rectum receiving between 12 approximately 15 Gy by 10 approximately 20 cc.

Here, an example will be shown of a direct method to reconstruct and demonstrate the dose and the dose distribution delivered to a particular patient. By measuring the radiation fields that come out of the accelerator, and using the measurement as input to a 3-dimensional (3D) dose algorithm, the delivered patient dose is determined and presented in a manner similar to the treatment plan. The intended treatment plan dose may be directly compared. Using this feedback mechanism, there is less abstraction and dependence upon the diligence of individuals checking multiple steps in a treatment process, and assumptions can be clearly stated.

Radiotherapy included 50 Gy to gross planning target volume (PTV) and 45 Gy to elective PTV in 25 fractions. Tomotherapy, IMRT, and 3DCRT plans were generated.

Statistical analysis was performed by paired t-tests. By isodose distributions and DVHs, tomotherapy plans showed sharper dose gradients, more conformal coverage, and better HI for both gross and elective PTVs compared with IMRT or 3DCRT plans. Mean V(20) of lung was significantly reduced in tomotherapy plans. However, tomotherapy and IMRT plans resulted in larger V(10) of lung compared to 3DCRT plans.

The mean PDR doses to points A and B were 3% +/- 1% and 6% +/- 1% higher than the LDR doses, respectively. For the rectum point, the PDR dose was 4% +/- 3% lower than the LDR dose, mainly because of the (192)Ir PDR source anisotropy.

The experiments were designed to allow a surface dose measurement and a depth dose profile with the pads placed in the path of the beam in front of the detector. All measurements were taken using a Capintec PS-033 thin-window parallel plate ionization chamber. The standard nylon-covered foam pad caused the surface dose to rise as it got closer to the skin. When the pad was directly touching the surface, the surface dose increased by 300% compared to the result when no pad was present. This loss of buildup to the surface was similar to that of a custom bolus material. The opposite effect occurred with the use of the helium-filled Mylar bag, namely the surface dose gradually decreased as the pad got closer to the phantom. When the Mylar pad was directly touching the phantom, the surface dose was decreased by 7% compared to when no pad was present. The use of a foam pad could potentially result in a significant higher dose to the skin, resulting in an enhanced acute skin reaction. Therefore, special care should be taken in this clinical scenario and further investigation of an air- or helium-based mylar support pad should be investigated in the context of definitive breast radiation treatment.'),('0958-3947','Experimental investigation of the implementation of Fermi-Eyges-Hogstrom electron beam model of the Pinnacle3 system at extended SSDs.','Heeteak','2007',40,'A commercially available ADAC Pinnacle(3) radiation treatment planning system has been used to model electron beams from a Varian Clinac 2300C/D in the energy range of 6 to 22 MeV.

As a first step for beam modeling, a number of dose profile and depth dose measurements were taken at standard source-to-surface distance (SSD) of 100 cm. Dose profiles and depth dose measurements at extended SSDs up to 120 cm are important for ascertaining accuracy of the model, as well as their clinical usefulness in the treatment of some sites (e.g., head-and-neck tumors). Modeled and measured beam data were compared. Over 98% of comparison points (modeled vs. measured) at 100-cm SSD were within 2.5% or 2.5 mm. At 110 cm SSD, over 98% of compared points were within 4% or 4 mm, and at 120-cm SSD, over 98% of compared points were within 5% or 5 mm. Overall, more than 98% of compared points were within 4% or 4 mm. Better models were produced for lower energies (6 to 15 MeV) than higher energies (18 and 22 MeV). For 6, 9, 12, and 15 MeV, 89% of compared points were within 2% or 2 mm. For 18- and 22-MeV electron energies, 75% and 67%, respectively, were within 2% or 2 mm.

The prescribed dose to the craniospinal axis was 2340 cGy at 180 cGy per fraction and was delivered with 6-MV photons. Before ovarian transposition, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis was obtained for localization of the ovaries and was registered with the planning computed tomography (CT) scan. Surgical clips allowed for CT localization of the ovaries after transposition. As a result of ovarian transposition, mean and maximum radiation doses decreased from 983 to 68 cGy and 1624 to 84 cGy for the left ovary and from 166 to 87 cGy and 723 to 103 cGy for the right ovary, respectively. Review of the literature indicates that such radiation doses are below the threshold that causes ovarian dysfunction and infertility. We conclude that ovarian localization with an MRI of the pelvis can be offered to females undergoing craniospinal irradiation.

Since extended fasts restore normoglycemia in diabetics, the resulting relief from glucotoxicity has been associated with a marked improvement in beta cell function that can be conserved after the fast if the factors precipitating diabetes--obesity, fatty and high-glycemic-index diets, sedentary lifestyle--have been adequately addressed. The new drug exenatide, an analog of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1, may be a worthwhile adjuvant to such fasting therapy, since it tends to counteract the glucolipotoxicity-induced down-regulation of the crucially important beta cell transcription factor IDX-1. Exenatide also exerts trophic effects on beta cell mass that in the longer term might help to restore diminished beta cell mass. Supraphysiological concentrations of biotin, possibly because they activate the soluble guanylate cyclase, also promote induction of IDX-1 and counteract the adverse impact of glucolipotoxicity in this regard; thus, high-dose biotin, which is well tolerated, may represent an additional adjuvant for therapeutic fasting intended to normalize beta cell function in type 2 diabetics.'),('0306-9877','Taking advantage of the experience in ethnomedicinal use of mushrooms: anti-inflammatory and related pharmacological activities of fly agaric (Amanita muscaria) ethanolic extract deserve a modern evaluation.','Aida','2007',45,'null'),('0306-9877','Integrating the negative psychotic symptoms in the high risk criteria for the prediction of psychosis.','S','2007',46,'null'),('0306-9877','Contrast-induced nephropathy as an indicator of diffuse endothelial dysfunction: introducing novel therapeutic options for decreasing the long-term mortality.','Mohammadali M','2007',47,'null'),('0306-9877','Does cortical reorganisation explain the enduring popularity of foot-binding in medieval China?','Paul D','2007',48,' by afferents that normally innervate the adjacent areas of cortex. This cross-activation between the different areas of the somatosensory cortex plays a large role in creating these phantom sensations. The same is also true of the motor cortex. After amputation of a limb, the deprived area of motor cortex does not remain nonfunctional but instead becomes active in the control of adjacent non-amputated muscle groups. It is notable that the genital area of the somatosensory cortex and the pelvic floor muscle area of the motor cortex are dislocated and in both cases lie adjacent to the foot area. Foot-binding of Chinese girls started around the 10th Century AD and for the next millennium was an extremely prevalent and popular custom. Mothers would tightly wrap their daughters\' feet from about the age of six years, thus preventing the feet from maturing normally. The aim of the process was to create as small feet as possible, since this would greatly enhance a girl\'s matrimonial prospects. Historians of the period have noted that Chinese men viewed foot-binding as conducive to better sexual intercourse because they believed that women with bound feet had vaginas that were more highly muscled and sensitive. We hypothesise that since foot-binding kept a girl\'s feet small and atrophic, this resulted in underutilisation of the foot areas of her somatosensory and motor cortices. This resulted in cross-activation between the redundant foot cortex and the adjacent genital areas in her brain. Hence women with bound feet devoted a disproportionately large area of the sensory and motor cortices of their brains to their genitalia and pelvic floor musculature, which made them more sensitive and pleasurable lovers.

This retrovirus is believed to assist primate T-cells attack the liver stage of the malaria infection. Each geographic region has a dominant primate host and a characteristic virus. Starting in 1955 and continuing into the late 1970s, chloroquine was provided by the WHO and used for prophylaxis against malaria. Chloroquine has a number of biochemical activities but two of the most important are blocking transcription of cellular genes and proviruses activated by NF-kappaB and blocking the glycosylation of surface proteins on viruses and cells. Concurrent with the development of resistance of the malaria parasite to chloroquine, HIV strains were quickly selected, which have enhanced transcription rates (by inclusion of multiple kappaB binding sites in their long terminal repeats by recombination) and enhanced infectivity (fusogenicity) (most likely by mutations in multiple viral genes that regulate glycosylation of Env). There also may have been mutations that enhanced activation of NF-kappaB in the host cell. These changes in the retrovirus genome were not manifest in effects of the HIV strains as long as the hosts were under the influence of chloroquine. But, when the virus infects people who are not protected by chloroquine, the virus multiplies more rapidly and is more communicable. Fortunately, most of these strains (i.e., HIV-2 groups, and HIV-1 O and HIV-1 N) self-regulate (i.e., infected cells kill infected cells) well enough that viral loads remain subdued and bystander cells of the immune system are not excessively attrited. In the case of HIV-1 group M, however, there is more going on. Following the work of Korber et al. on the phylogenetics of HIV-1 groups M, I reach the conclusion that the major subgroups giving rise to the worldwide pandemic, were founded in a 1927 clinical trial of pamaquine (plasmoquine) in Leopoldville (Kinshasa).

Increased levels of TH1 cytokines are produced by activated macrophages in the presence of an acute or chronic infectious disease and suppress the sensitivity of insulin receptors on the membrane of muscle cell and adipocytes. Both cells are activated by inflammatory cytokines and contribute to enhance acute inflammation and to maintain a state of chronic, low-grade inflammation in apparently healthy obese individuals. The increased number of macrophage in the adipose tissue of obese individuals acts as an amplifier of inflammation. Patients with osteoarthritis and metabolic syndrome frequently are complaining about hotness and recurrent edema of feet and hands. It is probable that hyperinsulinemia in the presence of insulin resistance and inflammation, induce vasodilation through the TNF mediated-iNOS overexpression. Patients with metabolic syndrome express clinically the consequence of a poor uptake, storage and energy expenditure by the muscle and any other insulin dependent tissue and the consequence of high insulin plasma levels are vasodilation and increased protein synthesis. The fatigue and muscle weakness induced by insulin resistance and inflammation in obese patients with metabolic syndrome increase the frequency and the intensity of traumatic events of peripheral or axial joints that result in stretch and breaking of tenoperiosteal junction and abrasive damage of cartilage and therefore in these patients with metabolic syndrome and pro-inflammatory state the reparative process of cartilage and periarticular tissues would be severely modified by the growth factor activity in presence of high levels of insulin.'),('0306-9877','Helicobacter pylori infection may increase renal resistive index.','Siren','2007',55,'null'),('0306-9877','Consideration of acamprosate for treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.','Eric Lewin','2007',56,'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease of degeneration of motor neurons.

NO is synthesized from L-arginine via the action of NO synthase (NOS), which is known to be blocked by endogenous L-arginine analogues such as asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). ADMA is a naturally occurring amino acid found in plasma and various types of tissues. Recently, it has been demonstrated that plasma levels of ADMA are elevated in patients with diabetes. It has also been reported that elevated plasma levels of ADMA are associated with increased risks of nonfatal stroke and myocardial infarction in patients with early diabetic nephropathy. These findings suggest that the elevated ADMA in diabetes could contribute to acceleration of atherosclerosis in this population. In diabetes mellitus, the formation and accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) progress. There is a growing body of evidence to show that AGEs are involved in the development and progression of atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes. Since ADMA is mainly metabolized by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), it is conceivable that the impairment of DDAH actions by AGEs could be one possible molecular mechanism of the ADMA elevation in diabetic patients. In this paper, we would like to propose the possible ways of testing our hypotheses. Does treatment with metformin, which has a potential effect on the inhibition of glycation reactions in vivo, decrease the levels of ADMA in diabetic patients? If the answer is yes, is this beneficial effect of metformin superior to that of other anti-diabetic agents with equihypoglycemic properties? Does treatment with pyridoxamine, a post-Amadori inhibitor (so-called Amadorins) of AGE formation, also reduce the levels of ADMA and subsequently improve endothelial dysfunction in diabetic patients? Are the ADMA-lowering effects of these agents associated with an increase of DDAH expression and/or activity in endothelial cells?

If circadian dysfunction can be established as an \'endophenotype\' for schizophrenia, it may not only enable the identification of more homogenous sub-groups, but also facilitate the genetic analyses. Therefore, circadian dysfunction maybe underlies the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and would be logical to investigate polymorphisms of genes encoding key proteins that mediate circadian rhythms. Cryptochrome1 (Cry1), located in a chromosomal region 12q23-q24.1, performs predominantly regulatory function in circadian clock and which is close to a linkage hotspot (12q24) of schizophrenia.

Recent research demonstrated that, in addition to protecting cells against apoptosis, the expression of survivin correlates with intratumoral microvessel density in several different types of tumors and survivin could upregulate several proangiogenic factors, including VEGF, Egr-1 and Siah-1. Moreover, Survivin DeltaEx3, one of the survivin alternative splice variants, is necessary for activating the small GTPase Rac1 during endothelial tube formation and required for in vivo endothelial cell invasion.

The hypothesis is as follows: There is a basic circuit of emotion which runs from the hippocampus (defined as the dentate gyrus plus the CA regions), where emotion arises, to the amygdala and from there to serotonergic pacemaker cells in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). The DRN projects back to the dentate gyrus in two ways: a direct route without a stop and an indirect route via pacemaker cells in the entorhinal cortex. The purpose of the direct route is to promote neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of the dentate; the indirect route has two purposes: to imprint ongoing moments of consciousness onto new dentate cells for retention as memory and to provide a negative feedback loop for regulation of the whole process. The hippocampus, the amygdala, and the DRN all project to the hypothalamus, which are branches off the basic loop that subserve the autonomic expression of emotion. Pathologic overdrive of the DRN causes overdrive of the entorhinal cortex, which leads to excitotoxic cell death of neurons in the hippocampus involved in the negative feedback loop. The disinhibited amygdala and DRN are then free to orchestrate the syndromes of chronic stress. Recovery from chronic stress requires repopulation of the dentate gyrus and restoration of the feedback loop. Excitotoxic cell death in the hippocampus results from either extraordinary acute stress or increased susceptibility to DRN overdrive, as might be caused, for example, by genetic factors, age, high cortisol levels, or incomplete recovery from previous damage. Three goals for therapeutic intervention are identified: inhibition of pacemaker cells in the DRN (which can be targeted by ethosuximide and other drugs that block serotonergic pacemaker currents), inhibition of pacemaker cells in the entorhinal cortex (which can be targeted by anti-epileptic drugs that block pacemaker currents in the entorhinal cortex, e.g. phenytoin), and restoration of serotonin levels in the dentate gyrus (which can be accomplished with anti-depressants). It is logical to use drugs from all three categories, either alone on in combination, to treat any of the four diseases of chronic stress. This leads to novel therapeutic recommendations, e.g. the use of ethosuximide, mood-stabilizers, and anti-depressants in synergy to treat essential hypertension.'),('0306-9877','The strange case of Dr HDL and Mr HDL: does a NO\'s story illuminate the mystery of HDL\'s dark side uncovered by Dr HDL\'s drug targeting CETP?','Pascal','2007',65,'Recently, the first large-scale morbidity and mortality trial (ILLUMINATE) to evaluate the cardiovascular end points of a CETP inhibitor (torcetrapib) has been prematurely stopped because the mortality was significantly increased in the treated group.

CETP inhibition would have enlarged HDL size resulting in a deficit in the interaction between HDL and the Scavenger Receptor class B type I (SR-BI), which is an important link between HDL and eNOS activation. We suggest than the deficit in NO secretion would have been sufficient among all patients to induce a destabilization of the plaques of atheroma, but could have induced a pathogenic increase in blood pressure only in patients whose eNOS activity was naturally weak due to genetic polymorphisms of this enzyme.

A few recent reports point to a peculiar disturbance of normal sexual dimorphism in brain regions implicated in the processing of emotions, including amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate. Prompted by these findings we compared cerebral activations between the sexes during performance of two emotion processing tasks and found overall much more extensive and intense cerebral activations in men than in women with schizophrenia. Moreover, the pattern of obtained sex differences in cerebral activation in patients differed significantly from what has been observed in the general population. Based on these preliminary structural and functional neuroimaging data, as well as some clinical reports, it is hypothesized in the present paper that schizophrenia is characterized by a reversed (or at least seriously disturbed) cerebral sexual dimorphism.

An optimal tissue thiamine status is pivotal for scavenging of reactive oxygen species and regeneration of ATP. There are several reasons to suppose that tissue thiamine availability is suboptimal in donor kidneys prior to reperfusion in transplantation.

Recently, the chemotaxis hypothesis has been paid more attention. Cancer cell with high expression of chemokine receptor will spread to the specific sites where the ligand is highly secreted. It has been demonstrated that SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling, one of the most important chemokine receptor-ligand complexes, was considered to play a critical role in pancreatic cancer organ-specific metastasis through some possible pathways. However, studies do not clarify the mechanism of SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling on pancreatic cancer progression. Beta-catenin, an important factor in canonical Wnt signaling pathway, also makes great contributions on cancer invasion and metastasis. It seems that Wnt/beta-catenin has a significant role in pancreatic cancer progression through interactions with different protein complexes. In the previous study of neural development, the relationship between SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling and beta-catenin has been described. It gave a clue to describe the correlation between SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling and Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. According to this, we postulate that beta-catenin is a promising key factor of SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling to regulate the metastasis of pancreatic cancer. With the stimulation of SDF-1 on highly metastatic pancreatic cancer cells, beta-catenin will separate from different complexes, translocate into the nucleus, trigger the expression of target genes and finally promote the migration of pancreatic cancer cells to specific sites. Through the observation of this crosstalk, it is possible to understand more clearly about the pancreatic cancer specific metastasis and to make some contributions on gene therapy of pancreatic cancer.'),('0306-9877','Schwann cell graft: a method to promote sensory responses of osseointegrated implants.','Zhen','2007',71,'Osseointegrated dental implants have been widely used in clinics to restore the missing teeth of patients.

Implant fracture or aggressive bone loss sometimes occurs because the patient cannot feel the overloads exerted on the implant. Until now, no available method has been issued to solve such a problem. Schwann cell is the glial cell of peripheral nerve system. It has been widely accepted to play indispensable roles during neural development and regeneration. Its mechanism includes forming Büngner\'s band, producing neurotrophic factors, synthesizing surface cell adhesion molecules, and elaborating basement membrane.

Immunoglobulin responses against several blood stage antigens were only partially associated with protection from symptoms in prospective immuno-epidemiological studies. HYPOTHESIS: Immunity to blood stages of P. falciparum is dependent on a specific pattern of immunoglobulin subclass responses to multiple blood stage antigens. SUPPORTING EVIDENCE FOR THE HYPOTHESIS: This hypothesis results from previous studies showing that IgG1 and IgG3 responses against antigens like ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigens, merozoite surface proteins and variant surface antigens on schizonts were associated with clinical immunity against malaria. None of the specific responses against a single antigen was completely protective. IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: A confirmation of the hypothesis would support efforts to generate a P. falciparum vaccine containing a comprehensive set of blood stage antigens, which, using adjuvant technology, would lead to the appropriate immunoglobulin subclass response. MEANS TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS: Detection of multiple immunorelevant P. falciparum blood stage antigens could be achieved by two-dimensional electrophoresis and blotting of the antigens onto nitrocellulose followed by exposure to the participant\'s serum. Bound immunoglobulins are visualized by isotype specific peroxidase conjugated anti-human immunoglobulin and quantified by transmission densitometry. The resulting pattern of responses for each immunoglobulin isotype could be compared between clinically immune participants remaining asymptomatic with subsequent P. falciparum infections and people who develop malaria.

One problem that may predispose those with trisomy 21 to hypothyroidism is the overexpression of the gene DYRK1A, which may have an affect on the thyroid. While thyroxine supplementation (such as Synthroid) is increasingly being advised for those with DS, this treatment may have both positive and negative effects. Nutritional support for hypothyroidism offers some of the same benefits as drug therapy but without the likely negative long-term effects. Early 20th century practitioners used bovine glandulars for those with DS children, which were believed to help support thyroid function. Some doctors in more recent times have also included iodine, L-tyrosine, selenium, and zinc. As nutrition for those with DS has been safely used by some practitioners for many decades, it is suggested that nutritional thyroid support, and not necessarily thyroxine, should be considered for use as a first line treatment for those with trisomy 21.

EpiT is generally regarded as a hormonally inactive 17alpha-epimer of testosterone (T). In rats, the kidney is the primary site of EpiT formation, whereas in humans it originates from the gonads, with only a small contribution secreted by the adrenals. Because the ratio of T to EpiT is nearly constant, it is presently used for assessing steroid abuse in competitive sports, where the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) considers a T/EpiT ratio >4 evidence of T doping. Despite its central role in the detection of illict anabolic steroid use, our knowledge of factors effecting EpiT production is poor. Clues in the literature, however, reveal that prostaglandin-mediated processes, such as LHRH release, may influence its production. Antimycotics, NSAIDs, and opioid analgesics used in sports medicine are all known to effect prostaglandin E2 synthesis. Primary PGs are potent inhibitors of ADT oxidation, while indomethacin, a prostaglandin blocker, powerfully inhibits 3alpha-HSD reduction and ADT oxidation. This is significant because ADT inhibits the oxidation of EpiT, and may modulate its antiandrogenic and neuroprotective effects. It is hypothesized that the T/EpiT ratio is increased by COX-2 inhibitors and opiod analgesics, and decreased by antimycotics that do not impair testosterone biosynthesis.

Current literature reveals an extensive list of mutations, drugs, toxins, metabolites and autoimmune antibodies that may impair TH action in the cell, but such impairment may not be picked up by assays of TH and TSH in blood plasma. Substances may induce tissue specific resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH), e.g. by affecting numbers of different TR isoforms. Recent literature also indicates mechanisms by which different conditions, for example, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), chronic renal failure (CRF) and nonthyroidal illness, can be accompanied by acquired RTH caused by inhibition of TH metabolism, cell uptake, TR binding and transcription. This prompts us to reassess commonness and rarity of congenital vs. acquired RTH. We hypothesise that observed clinical symptoms of hypothyroidism in chemically euthyroid patients are typically caused by changes in hormonal systems, autoimmune antibodies, metabolites or other substances in the body, leading to reduced sensitivity to TH in peripheral tissues. These changes may be a by-product of other processes and a reversible biological response in the body, and may also result in chronic acquired RTH. Antibodies may prove to be the most common cause of chronic reduction in TH sensitivity. It is argued that the acquired form of RTH, caused by endogenous and exogenous sources, may indeed be more common than the congenital, as in insulin resistance. If acquired RTH exists, then it may not be picked up by blood assays of TH and TSH.

The observed calcific changes in the cardiovascular system, however, does have a general pattern of occurring at structurally altered sites either due to disease processes or surgical manipulations. Areas of structural alterations, in conjunction with the pulsatile environment of the cardiovascular system, have been shown to disrupt normal pulsewave transmission throughout the arterial tree and induce local junctional or interfacial stress gradients. As such, these induced stress gradients can potentially aggregate and deposit cellular products and ionic particles at local sites to initiate calcification. A fundamental mechanism influencing all cardiovascular calcification is proposed based on pathophysiologic pulsewave propagations and reflections at these sites of structural changes.

The mechanistic rationale to explain these associations remains poorly understood. We believe that these seemingly unrelated entities may promote atherosclerosis through a common pathway by inducing adventitial autonomic dysfunction, specifically as an adventitial stress dysfunction of neurogenic origin. Atherosclerosis may represent a local vascular manifestation of the global autonomic dysfunction induced by age, smoking, hypertension, HIV, and diabetes. Atherosclerosis may also participate in a feed-forward cycle as aging, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension may also represent independent downstream consequences of global sympathetic bias. Chronic physiologic stress and behavioral stress can shift the autonomic balance towards a state of sympathetic predominance. The highly communicable nature of behavioral stress may partially implicate the familial association of atherosclerosis as an epigenetic phenomenon, independent of putative genetic mechanisms. Host stress, global autonomic dysfunction, and sympathetic bias may also arise from chronic maladaptive consumption of stressed foods, as organisms detect and assimilate the stress phenotypes of their dietary constituents through a process called xenohormesis. The benefits of exercise may operate through reduction of chronic physiologic stress associated with global sympathetic bias. The neurogenic adventitial stress response may explain the local tissue remodeling seen in atherosclerosis, including adventitial adipose dysfunction, inflammation, adventitial angiogenesis, thrombosis, and endothelial dysfunction. We believe that the locations of atherosclerotic lesions correspond to regions of neurogenic adventitial autonomic dysfunction, in similar fashion to the segmental patterns of involvement found in inflammatory bowel disease. The diffuse atherosclerosis exhibited in transplanted hearts may reflect a diffuse sympathetic bias of the donor heart, since tissues and organs exhibit an intrinsic sympathetic bias in the absence of an extrinsic source of autonomic hegemony.

These include many clinical populations with reduced limb loading, such as spinal cord injured patients, astronauts, elderly people with limited mobility and experimental bed-rest subjects. In some populations with decreased mobility, accumulation of fat in the bone marrow has been demonstrated. We hypothesize that adipocyte accumulation in bone marrow both passively and actively impairs erythropoiesis and thus defines a new type of anemia called anemia of immobility.

Based on evidence that hot flashes may be centrally mediated and that the stellate ganglion has links with the central nervous system nuclei that modulate body temperature, we hypothesize that the stellate ganglion block provides relief of hot flashes by interrupting the central nervous system connections with the sympathetic nervous system, allowing the body\'s temperature-regulating mechanisms to reset.

These stressors, acting primarily through the nitric oxide product, peroxynitrite, are thought to initiate a complex vicious cycle mechanism, known as the NO/ONOO- cycle that is responsible for chronic illness. The complexity of the NO/ONOO- cycle raises the question as to whether the mechanism that switches on this cycle is this complex cycle itself or whether a simpler mechanism is the primary switch. It is proposed here that the switch involves a combination of two variable switches, the increase of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and the partial uncoupling of the NOS activity, with uncoupling caused by a tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency. NOS uncoupling causes the NOS enzymes to produce superoxide, the other precursor of peroxynitrite, in place of nitric oxide. Thus partial uncoupling will cause NOS proteins to act like peroxynitrite synthases, leading, in turn to increased NF-kappaB activity. Peroxynitrite is known to oxidize BH4, and consequently partial uncoupling may initiate a vicious cycle, propagating the partial uncoupling over time. The combination of high NOS activity and BH4 depletion will lead to a potential vicious cycle that may be expected to switch on the larger NO/ONOO- cycle, thus producing the symptoms and signs of chronic illness. The role of peroxynitrite in the NO/ONOO- cycle also implies that such uncoupling is part of the chronic phase cycle mechanism such that agents that lower uncoupling will be useful in treatment.'),('0306-9877','Alpha-lipoic acid may be a clinically useful therapy in interstitial cystitis.','Grzegorz','2007',98,'null'),('0306-9877','Do reports of consciousness during cardiac arrest hold the key to discovering the nature of consciousness?','Sam','2007',99,'Perhaps the biggest challenge facing neuroscience at the dawn of the 21st century is understanding the relationship between mind, consciousness and the brain.

We localized a subset of previously characterized schistosome proteins identified in egg secretions in this study, to the surface of live S. mansoni eggs using the circumoval precipitin reaction.

In approximately 60% of cases gene conversion was responsible for the deletion while in the rest of the cases deletion occurred within the expression cassette. We used this observation to design constitutive and inducible expression vectors that could be stably integrated into the genome and subsequently depleted of the antibiotic resistance genes using thymidine kinase or bleomycin resistance genes as negative selection markers.

Compared with other rodent malaria parasites such as Plasmodium chabaudi, however, genetic mapping studies on P. yoelii have been limited, partly due to the absence of genetic markers and the lack of well characterized phenotypes. Taking advantage of the available genome sequence, we initiated a project to develop a high-resolution microsatellite (MS) map for P. yoelii to study malaria disease phenotypes. Here we report screening the P. yoelii genome for simple sequence repeats and development of an inexpensive method (modified from a previously reported procedure) for typing malaria parasite MS: instead of labeling individual polymerase chain reaction primers, a single fluorescently labeled primer was used to type the MS markers. We evaluated various polymerase chain reaction cycling conditions and M13-tailed/labeled M13 primer ratios to establish a simple and robust procedure for typing P. yoelii MS markers. We also compared typing efficiencies between individually labeled primers and the M13-tailed single labeled primer method and found that the two approaches were comparable. Preliminary analyses of seven P. yoelii isolates deposited at MR4 with 77 MS showed that the markers were highly polymorphic and that the isolates belonged to two groups, suggesting potential common ancestry or laboratory contaminations among the isolates. The MS markers and the typing method provide important tools for genetic studies of P. yoelii.

Here, we obtained partial or full-length var2CSA sequences from 106 parasites and applied novel computational methods and three-dimensional modeling to investigate VAR2CSA geographic variation and selection pressure. Our analysis reveals structural patterns of VAR2CSA sequence variation in which polymorphic sites group into segments of limited diversity. Within these segments, two or three basic types characterize a substantial majority of the parasite samples. Comparison to the primate malaria Plasmodium reichenowi shows that these basic types have ancient origins. Globally, var2CSA genes are comprised of a mosaic of these ancestral polymorphic segments that have recombined extensively between var2CSA alleles. Three-dimensional modeling reveals that polymorphic segments concentrate in flexible loops at characteristic locations in the six VAR2CSA Duffy binding-like (DBL) adhesion domains. Individual DBL domain surfaces have distinct patterns of diversifying selection, suggesting that limited and differing portions of each DBL domain are targeted by host antibody. Since standard phylogenetic tree analysis is inadequate for highly recombining genes like var2CSA, we developed a novel phylogenetic approach that incorporates recombination and tracks new mutations in segment types. In the resulting tree, P. reichenowi is confirmed as an outlier and African and Asian P. falciparum isolates have slightly diverged.

Knockdown of CSB prevents the association of Pol I with rDNA, impairs the interaction of G9a with Pol I, and inhibits pre-rRNA synthesis.

Instead, it results in impaired proliferation and premature senescence due to compensatory activation of p53. Combined loss of p73 and p53 rescues these defects, but at the expense of exacerbated genomic instability. This leads to rapid increase in polyploidy and aneuploidy, markedly exceeding that of p53 loss alone. Constitutive deregulation of cyclin-Cdk activities and excess failure of the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint appear to fuel increased ploidy abnormalities upon p53/p73 loss, while primary mitotic defects do not play a causal role.

We have studied two polymorphisms in the promoter region of the TNFalpha gene (TNF -308G/A and TNF -238G/A) in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with and without CVD. The aim was to assess the association of these polymorphisms with ESRD and cardiovascular comorbidity in hemodialyzed patients. METHODS: A total of 603 patients with ESRD treated with hemodialysis (382 patients with CVD) and 325 healthy control subjects were genotyped for the TNF -308G/A and TNF -238G/A ploymorphisms by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) procedure. RESULTS: The A allele of the TNF -308 polymorphism was more frequent in the ESRD group than in control individuals. The odds ratio (OR) for the risk allele was 2.05 (95% CI 1.48, 2.84). In the subgroup of ESRD patients with CVD, the OR was 5.76 (95% CI 3.67, 9.03) relative to ESRD patients without CVD. There was no association observed between the TNF -238 polymorphism and renal failure or CVD in ESRD patients. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate for the first time that the A allele of the TNF -308 polymorphism is associated with CVD in hemodialyzed ESRD patients. If confirmed in prospective studies, it may be a predictor of increased susceptibility to CVD in these patients.'),('1177-1062','The simple classification of multiple cancer types using a small number of significant genes.','Tae Young','2007',143,'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The problems involved in the classification of cancers have recently received a great deal of attention in the context of DNA microarrays. We propose a simple procedure for classifying or predicting the cancer types of test samples when multiple cancer types and many genes are present. METHOD: The procedure sequentially combines a gene-sort algorithm and a predictive likelihood-based classifier. Genes that have homogeneous patterns of expression measurements across cancer types are of limited interest. Therefore, this algorithm orders genes on the basis of strong heterogeneous patterns. The proposed classifier then selects the first few genes, which are sufficient to classify most training samples correctly via cross validation. Test samples were classified using only the selected genes. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: This predictive likelihood-based classifier performs well and is simple to understand.

The effect of TFP and other known DNA repair inhibitors like wortmannin and caffeine, on irradiated cells, was compared by MTT assay.

PM was sampled for 1-2 weeks, four samples at each site. The samples were extracted and examined for mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, YG1041 and YG5161, for content of inorganic elements and for the presence of eight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The induction of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression and the presence of DNA damage - tested by the comet assay - were determined after 24-h incubations with human A549 lung epithelial cells. The PM(2.5) concentration was about twofold greater in the oven hall than in the receiving hall. The particle size distribution in the receiving hall was similar to that in street air (maximum mode at about 25nm), but the distribution was completely different in the oven hall (maximum mode at about 150nm). Also chemically, the samples from the oven hall were highly different from the other samples. PM extracts from the receiving hall, street and background air were more mutagenic than the PM extracts from the oven hall. PM from all four sites caused similar levels of DNA damage in A549 cells; only the oven hall samples gave results that were statistically significantly different from those obtained with street-air samples. The receiving hall and the urban air samples were similarly inflammatory (relative IL-8 mRNA expression), whereas the oven hall did not cause a statistically significant increase in IL-8 mRNA expression. A principal component analysis separated the oven hall and the receiving hall by the first principal component. These two sites were separated from street and background air with the second principal component. Several clusters of constituents were identified. One cluster consisted of all the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), several groups of metals and one group of the biological endpoints (DNA damage, IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression). The PAH and the inorganic content of the air in the receiving hall may be due to vehicle emissions and suspended waste particles. The inorganic content in the street and background air may have been influenced by break wear, road emissions and long-range transport. The results from a partial least-square regression analysis predicted that both PAHs and a group of metals including Fe and Mn contributed to IL-6 and IL-8 induction. Only Mn and Sr were predicted to influence DNA damage statistically significantly. Among the PAHs only chrysene had influence on DNA damage. The PM from the oven hall was markedly different from the PM at other locations in particle size distribution, chemical composition and the resulting biological effects when A549 cells were incubated with the PM.

This approach very significantly discriminated the two ectomycorrhizal morphotypes formed with beech (Fagus silvatica) by Lactarius subdulcis and Cenococcum geophilum, which confirmed the ability of the latter fungal species to protect roots against desiccation already suggested by previous works.

Of all AMF clades, six (35.3%) were detected only on the basis of spores, six (35.3%) only in roots, and five corresponded to both spores and roots (29.4%). Although an Acaulospora species was the most dominant among spores (67.1%), it accounted for only 6.8% in root samples. A species analysis of AMF communities at different altitudes demonstrated that AMF species diversity increased as altitude decreased and that the species enrichment at lower altitudes resulted from the addition of new species rather than species replacement.

Plants were harvested, respectively, after 4 months or 1 year of growth and assessed for mycorrhizal root colonization. Spore counts and identification were also performed in the substrate, after the harvest of plants. Twenty-five taxa were identified considering all sites.

Differences in number of spores, diversity, and richness were found at the different sites of each State Park. Differences were also found when maize + peanut or A. angustifolia were used as trap plants. The traditional methodology using trap plants seems to underestimate the diversity of the AMF. The use of A. angustifolia as trap plant showed similar species richness to the field in PECJ, but the identified species were not necessarily the same. Nevertheless, for PETAR, both A. angustifolia and maize + peanut underestimated the species richness.

Using Maryland serpentine barrens and an Ohio alkaline prairie complex as model systems, we tested the hypothesis that the invasiveness of Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana L.) into such communities is regulated by the spatial pattern of ECM fungal inoculum in the soil. ECM colonization of pine seedlings can occur by (1) hyphae growing from the roots of mature ECM pines colonizing nearby seedlings (contagion model), (2) pine seedlings being infected after germinating in open areas where spores are concentrated in feces of animals that have consumed sporocarps (centers of infection model), and (3) colonization from spores that are wind-dispersed across the landscape (background model). To test these models of dispersal of ECM fungal inoculum into these barrens, we used autocorrelation and spatially explicit mapping techniques (semivariance analysis and kriging) to characterize the distribution and abundance of ECM inoculum in soil. Our results strongly suggest that ECM fungi most often disperse into open barrens by contagion, thereby facilitating rapid pine colonization in an advancing front from mature pine forests bordering the barrens. Spatial patterns consistent with the centers of infection model were present but less common. Thus, current management techniques that rely on cutting and fire to reverse pine invasion may be ineffective because they do not kill or disrupt hyphal mats attached to mature roots of neighboring pines.

Native neuroblastoma cell lines with differential expression of p75NTR differentially express 7dhcred; 7dhcred expression correlates with p75NTR expression.

Immunoreactivity to these markers was stronger in the supporting cells (Deiters and pillar cells) than the sensory cells and appeared later (23 months) in spiral ganglion cells and in the stria vascularis and spiral ligament. Conversely, antioxidant proteins (AIF) and enzymes (SOD2) decreased by 18 months in the organ of Corti (including the sensory cells) and spiral ganglion cells but not in the stria vascularis. These results suggest the presence of different reactive oxygen species and differential time courses of oxidative changes in individual tissues of the aging cochlea.

B-cells and mast cells do not contribute to this inflammatory response. Dendritic cells and T-cells appeared at about 12 months of age and their number increased further during aging. In 24-month-old animals a dense network of DCs interspersed with T-cells pervaded brain areas where substantial histopathological changes and a volumetric decrease have been reported.

Immunohistopathology also revealed that macrophages invaded the tumour tissue and in some cases engulfed GRID-labelled stem cells. No significant difference in macrophage recruitment between NSC-treated and vehicle-treated animals were detected, indicating that magnetically labelled NSC do not increase macrophage invasion of tumour tissue.

Therefore, using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we measured spatio-temporal brain activities during two types (two-dimensional (2D) and 3D rotation tasks) of mental rotation of 3D objects. Only the 3D rotation tasks required subjects to mentally rotate objects in a depth plane with visualization of hidden parts of the visual stimuli by acquiring and retrieving 3D information. In cases showing significant differences in the averaged activities at 100-ms intervals between the two rotations, the activities were located in the right dorsal premotor (PMd) at approximately 500 ms. In these cases, averaged activities during 3D rotation were greater than those during 2D rotation, implying that the right PMd activities are related to environmental monitoring. During 3D rotation, higher activities were observed from 200 to 300 ms in the left PMd and from 400 to 700 ms in the right PMd. It is considered that the left PMd is related to primary motor control, whereas the right PMd plays a supplementary role during mental simulation.

A region of the right posterior STS (pSTS) showed common activation to both face and hand motion, relative to radial grating motion, with no significant difference between responses to face and hand motion in this region. Distinct responses to face motion relative to hand motion were observed in the right mid-STS, while the right posterior inferior temporal sulcus (pITS) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) showed greater responses to hand motion relative to face motion. These findings indicate that while there may be distinct processing of different body part motion in lateral temporal and inferior parietal cortices, the response of the pSTS is not body part specific.

Both methods reduced the spectral power of BCG-related harmonics and enabled better detection of IEDs.

Components of the event-related potential (ERP) such as the N2 and the P3, but also oscillatory brain signals have been shown to distinguish between detected and missed stimuli, and thus, conscious perception. Here we investigate oscillatory responses that specifically relate to conscious stimulus processing together with potential ERP predictors. Our results show that successful target detection is associated with enhanced coherence in the low beta frequency range, but a decrease in alpha coherence before and during target presentation. In addition, we find an inverse relation between the P3 amplitudes associated with the first and second target. We conclude that the resources allocated to first and second target processing are directly mirrored by the P3 component and, moreover, that brain states before and during stimulus presentation, as reflected by oscillatory brain activity, strongly determine the access to consciousness. Thus, becoming aware of a stimulus seems to depend on the dynamic interaction between a number of widely distributed neural processes, rather than on the modulation of one single process or component.'),('1053-8119','Sex differences in cortical and subcortical recruitment during simple and complex motor control: an fMRI study.','Martin','2007',204,'In this study, we compared brain activation patterns in men and women during performance of a fine motor task, in order to investigate the influence of motor task complexity upon asymmetries of hemispheric recruitment. Thirty-three right-handed participants (17 males, 16 females) performed a self-paced finger-tapping task comprising three conditions of increasing complexity with both the dominant and the non-dominant hand. Imaging results demonstrated significant sex differences in brain activation patterns. While women showed significantly larger activation of ipsi- and contralateral task-related cortical areas than men, men exhibited significantly stronger subcortical activation in striatal regions. The observed activation differences may reflect sex differences in control of voluntary motor skills related to differential emphasis upon cortical and subcortical correlates of motor sequence processing, as well as differences in hemispheric recruitment, by means of which men and women can nevertheless achieve comparable motor performance.'),('1053-8119','Dissociable but inter-related systems of cognitive control and reward during decision making: evidence from pupillometry and event-related fMRI.','Randy L','2007',205,'Decision making involves the allocation of cognitive resources in response to expectations and feedback. Here we explored how frontal networks respond in a gambling paradigm in which uncertainty was manipulated to increase demands for cognitive control. In one experiment, pupil diameter covaried with uncertainty during decision making and with the degree to which subsequent outcomes violated reward expectations. In a second experiment, fMRI showed that both uncertainty and unexpected outcomes modulated activation in a network of frontal regions. Thus, the frontal network supports multiple phases of the decision-making process including information regarding reward uncertainty and reward outcome. In contrast, striatal activation only tracked reward delivery, suggesting a distinct reward pathway that might, under certain circumstances, oppose the frontal network. These results are consistent with the interpretation that reward signals may bias recruitment of frontal networks that are linked to allocation of cognitive resources.'),('1053-8119','A neural mass model of spectral responses in electrophysiology.','K J','2007',206,'We present a neural mass model of steady-state membrane potentials measured with local field potentials or electroencephalography in the frequency domain. This model is an extended version of previous dynamic causal models for investigating event-related potentials in the time-domain. In this paper, we augment the previous formulation with parameters that mediate spike-rate adaptation and recurrent intrinsic inhibitory connections. We then use linear systems analysis to show how the model\'s spectral response changes with its neurophysiological parameters. We demonstrate that much of the interesting behaviour depends on the non-linearity which couples mean membrane potential to mean spiking rate. This non-linearity is analogous, at the population level, to the firing rate-input curves often used to characterize single-cell responses. This function depends on the model\'s gain and adaptation currents which, neurobiologically, are influenced by the activity of modulatory neurotransmitters. The key contribution of this paper is to show how neuromodulatory effects can be modelled by adding adaptation currents to a simple phenomenological model of EEG. Critically, we show that these effects are expressed in a systematic way in the spectral density of EEG recordings. Inversion of the model, given such non-invasive recordings, should allow one to quantify pharmacologically induced changes in adaptation currents.

Here, a new method is presented using hyperoxia to perform the same calibration step. This procedure requires independent measurement of Pa(O2), the BOLD signal, and CBF.

Diffusion tractography was carried out in eight healthy adult subjects using diffusion data acquired at 1.5 T MRI (60 directions, b=1000 s/mm(2), 2 x 2 x 2 mm(3) voxels). The major connections that we identified from single seed voxels within STN or PPN were present in at least half the subjects and the topography of these connections within a 36-voxel region surrounding the initial seed voxel was then examined. Both the PPN and STN showed connections with the cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and down the spinal cord, largely matching connections demonstrated in primates. The topography of motor and associative brain areas in the human STN was strikingly similar to that shown in animals. PPN Topography has not been extensively demonstrated in animals, but we showed significant topography of cortical and subcortical connections in the human PPN. In addition to demonstrating the usefulness of PDT in determining the connections and topography of small grey matter structures in vivo, these results allow for inference of optimal DBS target locations and add to our understanding of the role of these nuclei in PD.'),('1053-8119','fMRI at 7 T: whole-brain coverage and signal advantages even infratentorially?','Mark E','2007',209,'fMRI is one of the most likely applications to benefit from high field MRI. It profits from the higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and increased BOLD contrast itself. However, this sensitivity to susceptibility brings with it problems, e.g. in-plane dephasing and signal dropouts near tissue-air boundaries. Therefore, most fMRI studies at 7 T focus on high resolution in supratentorial areas. Nine volunteers were measured at both 1.5 and 7 T using finger tapping with fMRI in a block design fashion. An EPI sequence with short TE (28 ms at 7 T) was chosen for covering the whole brain. A CP transmit/receive head coil was used for image acquisition. Statistical analyses were performed using SPM 02. The activated images were superimposed on both individual images and a standard T1-normalized brain dataset. All cerebral areas involved in finger tapping could be revealed using 7 T: SI, MI, SII, SMA, thalamus, and cerebellar areas. At 1.5 T the activation in the thalamus was only detectable in one subject using the same corrected p value for all analyses. Furthermore, the BOLD signal change was significantly higher at 7 T than at 1.5 T (factor 2 to 3). A well fitted response curve could be detected in all sensory-motor areas at 7 T in whole-brain coverage, even in areas suffering from susceptibility like the cerebellum.

However, BN provides a single snapshot of effective connectivity of the entire experiment and therefore is unable to accurately capture the temporal characteristics of connectivity. Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) use a Markov chain to model fMRI time-series and thereby determine temporal relationships of interactions among brain regions. Experiments on synthetic fMRI data demonstrate that the performance of DBN is comparable to Granger causality mapping (GCM) in determining the structure of linearly connected networks. Dynamic Bayesian networks render more accurate and informative brain connectivity than earlier methods as connectivity is described in complete statistical sense and temporal characteristics of time-series are explicitly taken into account.

However, MEG cannot reliably detect the radial component of the neuronal current. In contrast, the localization accuracy of electroencephalography (EEG) is not as good as MEG, but EEG can detect both the tangential and radial components of the source. In the present study, we investigated the conductivity dependence in a new approach that combines MEG and EEG to accurately obtain, not only the location and tangential components, but also the radial component of the source. In this approach, the source location and tangential components are obtained from MEG alone, and optimal conductivity values of the EEG model are estimated by best-fitting EEG signal, while precisely matching the tangential components of the source in EEG and MEG. Then, the radial components are obtained from EEG using the previously estimated optimal conductivity values. Computer simulations testing this integrated approach demonstrated two main findings. First, there are well-organized optimal combinations of the conductivity values that provide an accurate fit to the combined MEG and EEG data. Second, the radial component, in addition to the location and tangential components, can be obtained with high accuracy without needing to know the precise conductivity profile of the head.

With this framework, power can be calculated for specific areas of anticipated signals within the brain while accounting for the 3D nature of signals. This framework can also be extended to visualize local variability in sensitivity as a power map and a sample size map. We validated our non-central RFT framework based on Monte-Carlo simulations.

Consequently, it is often difficult to determine the underlying dynamics across dimensions. New techniques are needed to tackle these issues. Here, we address this multi-scalar problem by employing a novel predictive three-dimensional mathematical and computational model based on first-principle equations (conservation laws of physics) that describe mathematically the diffusion of cell substrates and other processes determining tumor mass growth and invasion. The model uses conserved variables to represent known determinants of glioma behavior, e.g., cell density and oxygen concentration, as well as biological functional relationships and parameters linking phenomena at different scales whose specific forms and values are hypothesized and calculated based on in vitro and in vivo experiments and from histopathology of tissue specimens from human gliomas. This model enables correlation of glioma morphology to tumor growth by quantifying interdependence of tumor mass on the microenvironment (e.g., hypoxia, tissue disruption) and on the cellular phenotypes (e.g., mitosis and apoptosis rates, cell adhesion strength). Once functional relationships between variables and associated parameter values have been informed, e.g., from histopathology or intra-operative analysis, this model can be used for disease diagnosis/prognosis, hypothesis testing, and to guide surgery and therapy.

Fifteen patients with left hemisphere lesions and seven healthy control subjects participated. Patients had both preoperative fMRI at 3 T and direct cortical stimulation. Patients and controls performed object naming and number counting during fMRI at 3 T. Laterality indices were calculated from the fMRI maps for the Number-counting>Object-naming and Object-naming>Number-counting contrasts. The same number-counting and object-naming paradigms were tested during awake craniotomy and assessed for sensitivity to speech disruption. In all patients during intraoperative cortical stimulation, speech disruption occurred at more sites during object naming than during number counting. Subtle speech errors were only elicited with the object-naming paradigm, whereas only speech arrest and/or hypophonia were measured using the number counting paradigm. In both patients and controls, fMRI activation maps demonstrated greater left lateralization for object naming as compared to number counting in both frontal and temporal language areas.

However, previous work suggests that the highly cellular dense mouse somatosensory cortex has different functional hemodynamic changes compared to other species. METHODS: We developed novel hardware and software for 2-dimensional optical spectroscopy (2DOS). Optical changes at four simultaneously recorded wavelengths were measured in both rat and mouse primary somatosensory cortex (S1) evoked by forepaw stimulation to create four spectral maps. The spectral maps were converted to maps of deoxy-, oxy-, and total-hemoglobin (HbR, HbO, and HbT) concentration changes using the modified Beer-Lambert law and phantom HbR and HbO absorption spectra. RESULTS:: Functional hemodynamics were different in mouse versus rat neocortex. On average, hemodynamics were as expected in rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1): the fractional change in the log of HbT concentration increased monophasically 2 s after stimulus, whereas HbO changes mirrored HbR changes, with HbO showing a small initial dip at 0.5 s followed by a large increase 3.0 s post stimulus. In contrast, mouse S1 showed a novel type of stimulus-evoked hemodynamic response, with prolonged, concurrent, monophasic increases in HbR and HbT and a parallel decrease in HbO that all peaked 3.5-4.5 s post stimulus onset. For rats, at any given time point, the average size and shape of HbO and HbR forepaw maps were the same, whereas surface veins distorted the shape of the HbT map. For mice, HbO, HbR, and HbT forepaw maps were generally the same size and shape at any post-stimulus time point. CONCLUSIONS: 2DOS using image splitting optics is feasible across species for brain mapping and quantifying the map topography of cortical hemodynamics. These results suggest that during physiologic stimulation, different species and/or cortical architecture may give rise to different hemodynamic changes during neurovascular coupling.'),('1053-8119','Role of neuronal activity and kinesin on tract tracing by manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI).','Russell E','2007',220,'MEMRI offers the exciting possibility of tracing neuronal circuits in living animals by MRI.

The gold standard continues to rely on probabilistic and indirect targeting, relative to a stereotactic reference, i.e., mostly the anterior (AC) and the posterior (PC) commissures. The theoretical position of a target defined on an atlas is transposed into the stereotactic space of a patient\'s brain; final positioning depends on electrophysiological analysis.

Limitations are precision of definition of the AC-PC line, probabilistic location and reliability of the electrophysiological guidance. Advances in MR imaging, as from 1.5-T machines, make stereotactic references no longer mandatory and allow an anatomic mapping based on an individual patient\'s brain. Direct targeting is enabled by high-quality images, an advanced anatomic knowledge and dedicated surgical software. Labeling associated with manual segmentation can help for the position analysis along non-conventional, interpolated planes.

While clinical series show that at least 50% of patients with chronic, pharmacoresistant neuropathic pain may benefit from this technique, the mechanisms of action of MCS remain elusive. In this review, we synthesise a number of studies that, combining electrophysiology and functional imaging, have permitted to proceed from phenomenology to models that may account for part of such mechanisms. MCS appears to trigger rapid and phasic activation in the lateral thalamus, which leads to a cascade of events of longer time-course in medial thalamus, anterior cingulate/orbitofrontal cortices and periaqueductal grey matter. Activity in these latter structures is delayed relative to actual cortical neurostimulation and becomes maximal during the hours that follow MCS arrest. Current hypotheses suggest that MCS may act through at least two mechanisms: activation of perigenual cingulate and orbitofrontal areas may modulate the emotional appraisal of pain, rather than its intensity, while top down activation of brainstem PAG may lead to descending inhibition toward the spinal cord. Recent evidence also points to a possible secretion of endogenous opioids triggered by chronic MCS.

This study showed that although there was no difference in location of the SP receptors in IBD patients versus controls, the quantity of SP binding was significantly increased in the inflamed mucosa of IBD patients, while the mRNA level was not increased. Further a difference in mRNA level between non-inflamed tissue of CD and UC patients was shown, with mRNA in CD being lower. These changes in SP receptor expression during chronic inflammation suggest that SP receptors are a potential target for therapeutic regulation of the inflammatory response.'),('0143-4179','Anxiolytic-like activity of the non-selective galanin receptor agonist, galnon.','Chad E','2007',231,'Galanin\'s influence on monoaminergic neurotransmission, together with its discrete CNS distribution in corticolimbic brain areas, points to a potential role for this neuropeptide in mediating anxiety- and depression-like responses. To evaluate this hypothesis, the non-selective galanin receptor agonist, galnon, was tested in multiple preclinical models of anxiolytic- and antidepressive-like activity. Acute administration of galnon (0.03-1mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently increased punished crossings in the four plate test, with magnitude similar to the effects of the endogenous ligand, galanin (0.1-1.0 microg, i.c.v.). Moreover, the effects of galnon and galanin were blocked by central administration of the non-selective galanin receptor antagonist, M35 (10 microg, i.c.v.). Interestingly, the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil (1mg/kg, i.p.), reversed galnon\'s effect in the four plate test, implicating GABAergic neurotransmission as a potential mechanism underlying this anxiolytic-like response. In the elevated zero maze, galnon (0.3-3.0mg/kg, i.p.) and galanin (0.03-0.3 microg, i.c.v.) increased the time spent in the open arms, while in the stress-induced hyperthermia model, galnon (0.3-30 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated stress-induced changes in body temperature. Consistent with these anxiolytic-like effects, in vivo microdialysis showed that acute galnon (3mg/kg, i.p.) treatment preferentially elevated levels of GABA in the rat amygdala, a brain area linked to fear and anxiety behaviors. In contrast to the effects in anxiety models, neither galnon (1-5.6 mg/kg, i.p.) nor galanin (0.3-3.0 microg, i.c.v.) demonstrated antidepressant-like effects in the mouse tail suspension test. Galnon (1-10mg/kg, i.p.) also failed to reduce immobility time in the rat forced swim test. In vitro, galnon and galanin showed affinity for human galanin receptors expressed in Bowes melanoma cells (K(i)=5.5 microM and 0.2 nM, respectively). Galanin displayed high affinity and functional potency for membranes expressing rat GALR1 receptors (K(i)=0.85 nM; EC(50)=0.6 nM), while galnon (10 microM) failed to displace radiolabeled galanin or inhibit cAMP production in the same GALR1 cell line. Galnon (10 microM) showed affinity for NPY1, NK2, M5, and somatostatin receptors but no affinity for galanin receptors expressed in rat hippocampal membranes. Taken together, the present series of studies demonstrate novel effects of galnon in various preclinical models of anxiety and highlight the galaninergic system as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of anxiety-related disorders. Moreover, these data indicate rodent GALR1 receptors do not mediate galnon\'s in vivo activity.'),('0143-4179','Time course of the hypothermic response to continuously administered neurotensin.','Bernd W','2007',232,'Intracerebroventricular administration of the tridecapeptide neurotensin is known to elicit hypothermia in rodents for few hours.

Male Wistar-Han rats (n=13) received neurotensin 10-50 microg/h for 48 h, while their body temperature was monitored continuously. This protocol led to a dose-dependent decrease of body temperature down to 35-36 degrees C. The nadir of hypothermia lasted for approximately 4h and normothermia was re-established after 12-24h. Furthermore, abundance of neurotensin in the hypothalamus was determined after 6 and 30 h by western blotting. High levels were still found at 30 h, while the rats had already become normothermic at that time.

Until now, more than 10 neuropeptides have been identified in bone. Substance P (SP) is a neuropeptide released from axons of sensory neurons, belongs to the tachykinin family and plays important roles in many physiological and pathological processes by acting as a neurotransmitter, neuromodulator, or trophic factor. It activates signal transduction cascades by acting on the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK(1)-R). Previous studies have confirmed that the SP-immunoreactive (IR) axons innervate bone and adjacent tissues, and that their density varies depending on the regions and physiological or pathological conditions. Over the past few decades, it has been found that SP takes part in the stimulation of bone resorption, and its receptors have been demonstrated to be located in osteoclasts. Notably, in studies of skeletal ontogeny, SP-IR axons have been shown to appear at an early stage, mostly coinciding with the sequence of long bone mineralization. These findings, together with data obtained from chemically or surgically targeted nerve deletions, strongly suggest that SP is a potent regulator of skeletal physiology. The specific distribution of SP-IR nerve fibers, the different amount of SP within regions, and the various levels of expression of NK(1)-R in targeted cells presumably related to and participate in bone metabolism. It can be predicted that the indirect roles of SP through other cytokines are as important as its direct roles in bone metabolism. This new regulating pathway of bone metabolism would have enormous implications in skeletal physiology and the relevant research might present curative potentials to a spectrum of bone diseases.'),('0143-4179','Effect of oxytocin on acupuncture analgesia in the rat.','Bao-Cheng','2007',234,' (St. 36) reduced oxytocin concentration in the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus, and elevated oxytocin concentration in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus, hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus, thalamic ventral nucleus, periaqueductal gray, raphe magnus nucleus, caudate nucleus, thoracic spinal cord and lumbar spinal cord, but did not alter oxytocin concentration in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, anterior pituitary, posterior pituitary and plasma.

Immunoreactive cells like 5HT, CCK-8, and SOM showed peak density in the villi and crypts of the small intestine and in the colonic glands of the large intestine, while cells containing SP were discerned predominately in the crypts. 5-HT, CCK-8 and SOM cells were mainly flask-shaped and of the open-variety, while PYY and SP immunoreactive cells were mainly rounded or basket-shaped and of the closed variety. Basically the distribution pattern of the endocrine cells in the duodenum, jejunum and colon of the one-humped camel is similar to that of other mammals.

Chronic morphine administration induces neurochemical adaptations in the noradrenergic system. The nature of signal responsible for opiate-induced adaptations of noradrenergic neurons in LC is not well defined. Neurotrophins-signaling pathways such as brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) play a key role for regulating the noradrenergic response of LC neurons to opiates. The nucleus paragigantocellularis (PGi) is one of the two major afferents to LC. The present study was designed to evaluate the expression of BDNF and NT-3 in the context of opiate dependence and withdrawal in PGi. Such data are important because they could reveal the role of PGi as an additional source of BDNF and NT-3 in the neurochemical plasticity of LC neurons. Opiate dependence was induced by a progressive intraperitoneal treatment of morphine. In morphine dependent group PGi nucleus was extracted for gene expression assay 6h after the last injection of morphine. In spontaneous withdrawal, rats received the same chronic treatment as morphine group. PGi was extracted for gene expression assay 24, 48 and 72 h after the last injection of morphine. PGi nucleus was assayed for the expression of BDNF and NT-3 using semi-quantitative RT-PCR normalized to beta-actin gene expression. Results showed that chronic administration of morphine significantly increased BDNF and NT-3 gene expression in PGi. In spontaneous withdrawal, BDNF/NT-3 genes expression were high in comparison to control group.

METHODS: Participants performed reciprocal aiming (Experiment 1) and 2-segment aiming movements (Experiment 2) on a digitizing tablet. In both experiments, target size and/or target orientation were manipulated to examine the influence of accuracy constraints on the planning and organization of movements. RESULTS: Kinematic measures, submovement analysis, and harmonicity measures were included in this study. Declines in organization and execution of multisegment movements were found to contribute to performance decrements and slowing in stroke patients. Furthermore, stroke patients were unable to efficiently plan multisegment movements as one functional unit, resulting in discrete movements.

Therapy-induced improvements in arm function may occur via restoration of premorbid movement patterns (recovery) or development of compensatory movement strategies. However, it is unclear whether the learning benefits of practice might be enhanced by incorporating different forms of feedback, focusing on movement outcomes or on specific arm movement patterns. OBJECTIVE: To determine if manipulation of attentional focus by providing either knowledge of results (KR) feedback, focusing on movement outcomes, or knowledge of performance (KP) feedback, focusing on arm movement patterns during repetitive practice of a pointing movement, may lead to arm motor recovery. METHODS: Twenty-eight chronic stroke survivors were randomly assigned to 2 groups that practiced 10 sessions of 75 pointing movements. During practice, groups received either 20% KR about movement precision or faded (26.6% average) KP about arm joint movements. A nondisabled control group (n = 5) practiced the same task with KR. RESULTS: Motor patterns recovered only in KP, as evidenced by immediate and long-term increases in joint range, better interjoint coordination in early movement phases, and generalization of gains. Improvements in clinical impairment and function were related to decreases in compensation (trunk rotation) and recovery of interjoint coordination in mid-movement phases. CONCLUSIONS: In stroke survivors, when the learners\' attention was directed to the movements themselves (KP), motor improvements reflect recovery compared to when attention was directed toward movement outcomes (KR).'),('1545-9683','Evolution of FMRI activation in the perilesional primary motor cortex and cerebellum with rehabilitation training-related motor gains after stroke: a pilot study.','Bruce H','2007',240,'BACKGROUND: Previous studies report that motor recovery after partial destruction of the primary motor cortex (M1) may be associated with adaptive functional reorganization within spared M1.

METHODS: Four patients with hemiparesis for more than 3 months after a cortical lesion partially within M1 and 12 healthy volunteers participated. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using a finger-tapping task and concurrent behavioral assessments, including the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment of the upper extremity and the Wolf Motor Function Test, were conducted before and after 2 weeks of arm-focused training; 2 patients were further examined 6 and 12 months later to evaluate long-term persistence of brain-behavior adaptations. RESULTS: All patients showed higher activation magnitude in perilesional M1 than healthy controls before and after therapy. Further long-term functional gains paralleled the decrease of activation magnitude in perilesional M1 in the 2 more impaired cases. CONCLUSION: The evolution of suggestive correlations between serial scans of fMRI adaptive activity within the primary motor cortex and the cerebellum in relation to relevant behavioral changes over the course of 2 weeks of task-specific therapy and then no formal therapy suggests that repeated assessments may be best for monitoring therapy-induced neuroplasticity.

Of the 20 patients, only 14 could perform the grip-lift task, which is an objective measure of dexterity. Patients in the stimulation group exhibited significantly greater improvements in this task than the control group. There was no significant change in corticospinal excitability in either group.

Each rater assessed 1836 combinations based on summary documents on carcinogenic agents, which included descriptions of sources of exposure and products, descriptions of work processes carried out within the different job categories, and monitoring data. Inter-rater agreement was calculated using Cohen\'s kappa index and single and average score intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) (ICC(2,1) and ICC(2,8), respectively). Differences in inter-rater agreement for time periods, raters, International Agency for Research on Cancer groups and the amount of information provided were consequently studied. RESULTS: Overall, 18% of the combinations were denoted as possible exposure, and 14% scored probable exposure. Stratified by the 17 carcinogenic agents, the probable exposure prevalence ranged from 3.8% for refractory ceramic fibres to 30% for crude oil. Overall mean kappa was 0.42 (ICC(2,1) = 0.62 and ICC(2,8) = 0.93). Providing limited quantitative measurement data was associated with less agreement than for equally well described carcinogens without sampling data. CONCLUSION: The overall kappa and single-score ICC indicate that the raters agree on exposure estimates well above the chance level. The levels of inter-rater agreement were higher than in other comparable studies. The average score ICC indicates reliable mean estimates and implies that sufficient raters were involved. The raters seemed to have enough documentation on which to base their estimates, but provision of limited monitoring data leads to more incongruence among raters.

METHODS: All 630 individuals employed at a polymer production facility using PFNA (CAS No 72968-38-8) at any time between 1 January 1989 and 1 July 2003 were included in the cohort. Plausibly related laboratory test results were abstracted from annual medical examination records, including liver enzyme function and blood lipids. Detailed work histories, available for all employees, provided the basis for determining exposure category. Thirty two clinical parameters were evaluated by exposure level at five points in time, determined to reflect changes in possible exposure intensity, as well as greatest number of records available. Annual cross-sectional analyses and longitudinal analyses that accounted for multiple measurements per person were conducted separately for men and women, by exposure groups. RESULTS: Differences by exposure group for all laboratory measures, adjusted for age and body mass index, were small and not clinically significant. Although some statistically significant pair-wise differences were observed, these observations were not consistent between men and women, or over the five analysis windows.

These particles are regulated on a mass basis in occupational settings, but mass might not be the appropriate metric as animal studies have shown that nanoparticles (ultrafine particles) produce a stronger adverse effect than fine particles when delivered on an equal mass basis. METHODS: This study investigated whether the surface area is a better descriptor than mass of LSLTP of their ability to stimulate pro-inflammatory responses in vitro. In a human alveolar epithelial type II-like cell line, A549, we measured interleukin (IL)-8 mRNA, IL8 protein release and glutathione (GSH) depletion as markers of pro-inflammatory effects and oxidative stress after treatment with a range of LSLTP (fine and nanoparticles) and DQ12 quartz, a particle with a highly reactive surface. RESULTS: In all the assays, nanoparticle preparations of titanium dioxide (TiO2-np) and of carbon black (CB-np) produced much stronger pro-inflammatory responses than the same mass dose of fine TiO2 and CB. The results of the GSH assay confirmed that oxidative stress was involved in the response to all the particles, and two ultra-fine metal dusts (cobalt and nickel) produced GSH depletion similar to TiO2-np, for similar surface-area dose. As expected, DQ12 quartz was more inflammatory than the low toxicity dusts, on both a mass and surface-area basis. CONCLUSION: Dose-response relationships observed in the in vitro assays appeared to be directly comparable with dose-response relationships in vivo when the doses were similarly standardised. Both sets of data suggested a threshold in dose measured as surface area of particles relative to the surface area of the exposed cells, at around 1-10 cm2/cm2. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that surface area is a more appropriate dose metric than mass for the pro-inflammatory effects of LSLTP in vitro and in vivo, and consequently that the high surface area of nanoparticles is a key factor in their inflammogenicity.'),('1470-7926','A simple diagnostic model for ruling out pneumoconiosis among construction workers.','Evert','2007',252,' and FEV1 were independent predictors in the diagnostic model.

Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were computed using US and South Carolina mortality rates. A job exposure matrix provided calendar time dependent estimates of chrysotile exposure concentrations. Poisson regression models were fitted for lung cancer and asbestosis. Covariates considered included sex, race, age, calendar time, birth cohort and time since first exposure. Cumulative exposure lags of 5 and 10 years were considered by disregarding exposure in the most recent 5 and 10 years, respectively. RESULTS: A majority of the cohort was deceased (64%) and 702 of the 1961 deaths occurred since the previous update.

Mortality remained elevated for these causes when South Carolina referent rates were used. Three cases of mesothelioma were observed among cohort members. Exposure-response modelling for lung cancer, using a linear relative risk model, produced a slope coefficient of 0.0198 (fibre-years/ml) (standard error 0.00496), when cumulative exposure was lagged 10 years. Poisson regression modelling confirmed significant positive relations between estimated chrysotile exposure and lung cancer and asbestosis mortality observed in previous updates of this cohort.

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether restrictive drinking social norms shared by workgroup membership are associated with decreased heavy drinking, frequent drinking and drinking at work at the worker level. METHODS: The sample included 5338 workers with complete data nested in 137 supervisory workgroups from 16 American worksites. Multilevel models were fitted to examine the association between workgroup drinking norms and heavy drinking, frequent drinking and drinking at work. RESULTS: Multivariate adjusted models showed participants working in workgroups in the most discouraging drinking norms quartile were 45% less likely to be heavy drinkers, 54% less likely to be frequent drinkers and 69% less likely to drink at work than their counterparts in the most encouraging quartile. CONCLUSIONS: Strong associations between workgroup level restrictive drinking social norms and drinking outcomes suggest public health efforts at reducing drinking and alcohol-related injuries, illnesses and diseases should target social interventions at worksites.'),('1470-7926','The precautionary principle: in action for public health.','Marco','2007',255,'null'),('1470-7926','Problems in applying the precautionary principle to public health.','Bernard D','2007',256,'null'),('1470-7926','The IARC Monographs: a resource for precaution and prevention.','Vincent James','2007',257,'null'),('1470-7926','The reactionary principle: inaction for public health.','David','2007',258,'null'),('1470-7926','The precautionary principle in the context of multiple risks.','L','2007',259,'null'),('1470-7926','Selecting appropriate study designs to address specific research questions in occupational epidemiology.','David','2007',260,'Various epidemiological study designs are available to investigate illness and injury risks related to workplace exposures.

Recent evidence indicates that \'mild asthma\' may not be as benign a condition as was widely believed and should be treated to improve asthma control and to prevent the significant burden of exacerbation and progression of disease. This is supported by compelling evidence from histologic and clinical studies that have attributed irreversible pathologic and functional airway changes to consequences of persistent airway inflammation and under-treated asthma. This article focuses on the rationale of early treatment of mild persistent asthma, and discusses the various findings from the largest randomized, early-intervention trial with inhaled corticosteroids as regular treatment in patients with asthma of recent onset--the START (inhaled Steroid Treatment As Regular Therapy in early asthma) study. A brief review of the background of the natural history of asthma, the findings from key longitudinal epidemiologic studies on disease progression in children and adults, and the effect of inhaled corticosteroids on this progression are included, to provide further insight into the impact of early treatment on asthma management guidelines.');
